# Web Development Final Project - *Atlanta Community Events Forum*

This web app allows users to create, serach, and view upcoming events happening in the Atlanta Area. Users can create new events by filling out a form and entering the event name, date, location, and a description of the event. If the user wants to edit or delete the event, they also have the option to do so. Once the event is posted, other users can view it, like it, and leave comments. Lastly, all users can filter and sort events.

## Features

-  **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
-  **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**
-  **A home feed displaying previously created posts**
-  **By default, the time created, title, and number of upvotes for each post is shown on the feed**
-  **Clicking on a post shall direct the user to a new page for the selected post**
-  **Users can sort posts by either their created time or upvotes count**
-  **Users can search for posts by title**
-  **A separate post page for each created post, where any additional information is shown is linked whenever a user clicks a post**
-  **Users can leave comments underneath a post on the post's separate page**
-  **Each post should have an upvote button on the post's page. Each click increases its upvotes count by one and users can upvote any number of times**
-  **A previously created post can be edited or deleted from its post page**

## Future Implementations
- Save comments in database to view them after page refresh
